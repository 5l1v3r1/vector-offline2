Hello Andrea, What I meant is, on the native 'hfsplus' driver, by adding '/rsrc' at the end of the file name and looking at it as if it was a directory, you may be able to get the actual contents of a seemingly empty file: 

	root@fsd-linux-lic-bs-01:~# ls -l /mnt/test/Applications/Automator.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator 
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar 17 16:05 /mnt/test/Applications/Automator.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator 

	root@fsd-linux-lic-bs-01:~# ls -l /mnt/test/Applications/Automator.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator/rsrc 
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 123879 Mar 17 16:05 /mnt/test/Applications/Automator.app/Contents/MacOS/Automator/rsrc 

However, we can't guarantee it that will work every time.

Linux can only list the files inside a directory if the directory itself have executable attribute. 
Since you are opening the file as it was a directory, the same rule applies. 
Therefore, you must do the following: 

1.Forcefully mount the volume for read/write: 

	# mount -t hfsplus -o force,rw /dev/sdX /mnt 

2.Add executable attribute for the desired file: 

	# chmod +x /mnt/etc/networks 

3.Now, you can test it again: 

	# ls -l /mnt/etc/networks/rsrc
